# Online_Registration
this code it hold how the online registration it will be
This project is an online course registration system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Java Servlets for the backend. The system enables students to register for courses online by viewing available courses and enrolling in their chosen ones. Admins can manage courses, semesters, teachers, and students through a dashboard with full CRUD operations. The application also provides an overview of the number of students per semester and their course choices. Built with Java, Apache Tomcat, and MySQL, it requires setting up the database, configuring connection details, building the project with Maven or Gradle, and deploying to Tomcat. For usage, students can register and log in to enroll in courses, while admins manage all entities and view reports. Contributions are welcome. For more details, contact antoni.kigali@gmail.com.
